        Hello!
    </h1>
</header>


<h2>My name is Ryan Kelly.</h2>
<p>
    I was born and raised in the very beautiful city, Flagstaff, Arizona.
</p>

<p>
    I completed my undergraduate work at Northern Arizona University in Mathematics and Physics, with a minor in CS, from 2017 through 2021.
    I additionally attended NAU for my Master of Science in mathematics from August 2021 through May 2023. I am very
    fortunate to have been a Graduate Teaching Assistant at NAU where I taught several college math courses.
</p>

<p>
    My mathematical interests include, but are not limited to, differential equations, numerical analysis, Lie groups,
    and algebraic geometry; however, I am certainly not an expert in any of these areas. My undergraduate research
    is primarily tied to numerical analysis of differential equations, and my graduate research is on the study of Birkhoff
    polynomial interpolation with applications to finite differences and quadrature.
</p>

<p>
    After graduation in May 2023, I have decided to shift focus to the general area encompassed by data
    analysis, data science and machine learning. My background in math and CS has greatly aided my entry into this field.
    I initially gained interest in this area after taking a graduate course in the foundations of neural networks where
    I developed a strong understanding of basic sequential dense and convolutional neural networks.
</p>
<p>
    Since then, I have committed my time to gaining hold in the foundations of the broad field of Machine Learning.
    My goal is to complete much of the coursework in Python and SQL provided by
    <a href="https://www.datacamp.com/" target="_blank">DataCamp</a>, then obtain their certifications.
    I am also focused on building a portfolio of personal projects in data science and ML, as well
    as participating in <a href="https://www.kaggle.com/" target="_blank">Kaggle</a> competitions.
